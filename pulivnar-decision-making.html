        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The human brain is a remarkably intricate network, with specialized regions dedicated to processing and integrating diverse forms of sensory information to guide our behavior. Among these, the dorsal pulvinar, a region located within the thalamus, has recently sparked significant interest in the scientific community. Although its enlargement and distinctive connectivity in humans hint towards its involvement in complex cognitive and visuomotor functions, empirical evidence remains scarce. A recent case study in which I had the privilege of contributing significantly allows us to explore the function of the dorsal pulvinar in the human brain further.</p>

        <h2>A Unique Case Study</h2>
        <p>We had the unique opportunity to study a 31-year-old patient, M.B., with a lesion centered on the medial portion of the dorsal pulvinar due to atypical Sarcoidosis manifestation. In contrast to lesions of vascular etiology, M.B.'s lesion did not impact primary sensory or motor thalamic nuclei. This circumstance offered us a rare chance to study the contributions of the dorsal pulvinar to human visuomotor behavior without confounding factors in the primary sensory or motor domains.</p>

        <h2>The Findings</h2>
        <p>Our findings revealed some intriguing results. While M.B.'s saccades (rapid eye movements) were hypometric towards both visual hemifields, we found no spatial choice bias or perceptual deficits. Concurrently, M.B. exhibited difficulties in reach and grasp, with characteristics reminiscent of both parietal and cerebellar damage. He struggled to form a precision grip and showed reach deficits in decreased accuracy, delayed initiation, and prolonged movement durations. These reach deficits were consistent across foveal and extrafoveal viewing conditions and in both visual hemifields, although they were more pronounced with his right hand.</p>

        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>One of my significant contributions to this research was establishing that the described lesion did not influence perceptual decision-making. This finding underscores the distinct roles of the dorsal pulvinar in humans, suggesting that its function extends beyond its prescribed role in visual cognition, playing a crucial part in the programming of voluntary actions with the hands.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our research offers valuable insights into the complexity and functionality of the human brain, particularly the dorsal pulvinar's role in visuomotor performance. However, further research is needed to fully grasp this brain region's extent and influence on cognitive and motor functions. We hope that our work will spark more interest and contribute to our collective knowledge in this fascinating field of study.
