    <h1>Summary:</h1>
    <p>Highly skilled medical and science writer with a deep knowledge base in neuroscience and medicine. I hold a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Göttingen, Germany, and a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from the University of Jordan, providing a unique fusion of scientific acumen and clinical insight to my writing. I've successfully crafted engaging, insightful content in medical and scientific research as a freelance writer, honing my writing skills and translating complex scientific ideas into accessible, engaging narratives. I've further developed my skills in AI consulting, systematic reviews, whitepapers, continous medical education (CME), needs assessments, and science publication. With a focus on neuroscience, neurology, and radiology, my advisory roles have broadened my understanding and contribution to the field. Committed to delivering accurate, evidence-based material, my goal is to positively impact medical and scientific communication.</p>
