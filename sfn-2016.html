        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Embarking on the journey of my PhD, my intrigue gravitated towards understanding the intricate process of how humans make decisions. This requires a remarkable ability to perceive, accumulate, and integrate information.</p>

        <h2>The Research Question</h2>
        <p>Given the existing theory that sensory information is processed in modality-specific sensory regions, under the influence of fronto-parietal cortices to form spatial decisions, I began to question - do these brain regions accumulate modality-specific sensory evidence, or evidence that directs an action?</p>

        <h2>The Methodology</h2>
        <p>In pursuit of answers, we designed a study with two principal objectives during my doctoral research. The study employed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique on 17 healthy human subjects along with patients harboring lesions in parietal cortices. The chosen methodology was a spatial perceptual accumulation task, utilizing both visual and auditory modalities.</p>

        <h2>The Findings</h2>
        <p>My findings showed that regions correlating with the signed evidence were the occipital cortex for the visual task, and the superior temporal gyrus for the auditory task. In a fascinating turn, the fronto-parietal cortices didn't align with the signed evidence but with the absolute evidence in both modalities.</p>

        <h2>The Impact</h2>
        <p>Patients with unilateral parietal cortex lesions exhibited a performance decrease in both the visual and auditory tasks. This crucial observation suggests that sensory evidence appears to accumulate in modality-specific sensory cortices, while supramodal activity in parietal cortices might reflect evidence pointing towards an action choice.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The learnings from this study, presented as an abstract at the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) 2016 in San Diego, highlighted interesting facets of spatial decision-making. They continue to be instrumental in providing deeper insights into our understanding of the brain.</p>
